# SMS Service Setup for Combined Verification

## Overview

The combined verification system now sends phone verification codes via **actual SMS** to ensure real phone number ownership. This prevents users from using fake/dummy phone numbers.

## üîí **Security Benefits**

- **Real ownership verification** - User must have access to the actual phone
- **Prevents fake numbers** - Can't verify with dummy phone numbers
- **Compliance** - Meets security standards for phone verification
- **Dual verification** - Both email and phone must be real and verified

## üì± **Supported SMS Services**

### 1. **Twilio** (Recommended for International)
```bash
# Environment Variables
SMS_SERVICE_TYPE=twilio
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number
```

### 2. **MSG91** (Popular in India)
```bash
# Environment Variables
SMS_SERVICE_TYPE=msg91
MSG91_AUTH_KEY=your_auth_key
MSG91_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
MSG91_FLOW_ID=your_flow_id
```

### 3. **AWS SNS**
```bash
# Environment Variables
SMS_SERVICE_TYPE=aws_sns
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

### 4. **Generic HTTP SMS Service**
```bash
# Environment Variables
SMS_SERVICE_TYPE=generic
SMS_SERVICE_API_KEY=your_api_key
SMS_SERVICE_URL=https://your-sms-service.com/api/send
```

## üöÄ **Quick Setup**

### Step 1: Choose SMS Service
Select one of the supported SMS services based on your location and requirements:

- **India**: MSG91 (cost-effective, good delivery rates)
- **International**: Twilio (reliable, good support)
- **AWS Users**: AWS SNS (integrated with AWS ecosystem)
- **Custom**: Generic HTTP service (for any SMS provider)

### Step 2: Get API Credentials
1. Sign up for your chosen SMS service
2. Get API keys, authentication tokens, etc.
3. Note down the service-specific configuration

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
Add the required environment variables to your Supabase project:

```bash
# Go to Supabase Dashboard > Settings > Environment Variables
# Add the variables for your chosen service
```

### Step 4: Test the System
1. Deploy the updated edge functions
2. Test with a real phone number
3. Verify SMS delivery and verification flow

## üí∞ **Cost Considerations**

### SMS Costs (Approximate)
- **India (MSG91)**: ‚Çπ0.15 - ‚Çπ0.30 per SMS
- **International (Twilio)**: $0.0079 per SMS
- **AWS SNS**: $0.00645 per SMS

### Cost Optimization
- **Development**: Use development mode (logs SMS instead of sending)
- **Testing**: Use test phone numbers provided by SMS services
- **Production**: Monitor SMS delivery rates and costs

## üîß **Development vs Production**

### Development Mode
- SMS codes are logged to console instead of being sent
- No SMS costs during development
- Easy testing and debugging
